##Readme

This repository includes three files:

Q2_bashscript.sh is for the question 2.And the bash script is tested on my MAC OS.

Q3_analysexml.py is a python scirpt for the question 3,whose print out includes the result of (a) and (b),so that 
you can run it directly and see the result of (a) and (b).And the xml file is included in this repository by the way.

I have tested the two scripts and it can work well in my mac and pycharm.

If you have any problem in running the code please to contact me,thank you.
